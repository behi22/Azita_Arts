      <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
      <p>Hi, My name is Azita Mohammad Alipour and I am a painter.</p>
      <p>My goal of drawing and painting is to combine traditional and conceptual techniques and I try to take a new look at the issues of everyday life through modern art.</p>
      <p>To achieve this goal, I tried to strengthen the painting technique with respect to the subject and its model, Because the attention to advanced technique has a great effect in expressing the concept from the viewer's point of view.</p>
      <p>The paintings that i decided to put on this website are mostly Realism. Realism, sometimes called naturalism, in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.</p>
      <p>Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects, it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. It becomes especially marked in European painting in the Early Netherlandish painting of Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck and other artists in the 15th century. However such "realism" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century Realism art movement painters such as Gustave Courbet are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of academic painting, which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes. It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances. Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and "veristic" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between "realistic" (usually related to visual appearance) and "realist" is often useful, as is the term "illusionistic" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.</p>
      <p>There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema.</p>
